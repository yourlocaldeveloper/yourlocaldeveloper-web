[yourlocaldev](https://www.yourlocaldev.com/) is my personal website. It's a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project.

## Getting Started

To run it locally:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## About It

I built it using Next.js using a Atomic component design. It's fairly simple but charmful.
